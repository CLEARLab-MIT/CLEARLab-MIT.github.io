                We encourage prospective PhD students to apply to the MIT <a href="https://aeroastro.mit.edu/education/graduate-admission/">AeroAstro PhD Program</a> (specifically the Computing sector) before the deadline (typically December 1st).
                Additionally, students may optionally apply to the MIT <a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics/graduate-programs/admission-process/">EECS PhD Program</a> before the deadline (typically December 15th).
                While I monitor applications to both departments, students are strongly encouraged to apply to AeroAstro, as it is the home department of the CLEAR Lab.
                Please read my <a href="www.mit.edu/~abobu/assets/pdf/advising.pdf">advising statement</a> if you are considering applying and look at our <a href="research.html">research page</a> for a sense of what we're working on.
                In your application, make sure to mention my name under faculty you are interested in working with.
                Additionally, check if you are eligible for a <a href="https://oge.mit.edu/graduate-admissions/applications/application-fee-waiver/">fee waiver</a> and look up the MIT <a href="https://oge.mit.edu/community-diversity/prospective-students/graduate-application-assistance-programs-gaap/">Graduate Application Assistance Program</a>, which provides application writing support.
              </p>

                Our lab receives a lot of interest, so I unfortunately cannot respond to every email regarding admissions.
                However, once you have submitted your application, you are encouraged to contact me via email with the subject heading <nobr><em style="color:black;">"Prospective PhD Student"</nobr></em>.
                Please include your CV, transcript, and a 1-2 paragraph cover letter with a description of your relevant past research experience, your future research interests, and why you want to work with me.
              </p>

                We are not currently conducting a formal postdoc search. 
                However, if you believe you have a strong research fit and case for joining our lab, you can email me with the subject heading <nobr><em style="color:black;">"Prospective Postdoc"</nobr></em> and include your CV and a 1-2 paragraph cover letter with a description of your past research experience and what you would like to accomplish in our lab.
              </p>

                Please send me an email with the subject heading <nobr><em style="color:black;">"Current PhD Student"</nobr></em> and include your CV and a 1-2 paragraph cover letter with a description of your past research experience in ML, robotics, or human-robot interaction, your future research interests, and why you want to work with me.
                In your email, please indicate whether you will need funding.
                If you have received a fellowship it will be significantly easier to place you.

              <p>
                If you are at another undergraduate institution in the US, you should apply to the <a href="https://oge.mit.edu/msrp/">MIT Summer Research Program</a> in December / January.
                If you are a prospective Masters student, I would love to chat more about potential research collaborations after you have been admitted to one of MIT's MS programs.
                If you are a high school student, you should apply to <a href="https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/">PRIMES</a>.
